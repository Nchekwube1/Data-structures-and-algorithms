// A linked list consists of elements with no indicees who are just pointing to the next element. Linked lists consists of nodes and each
// node has a value and a pointer to another node or null to signify the end of the singly linked list
// Each node is only connected one directionally to the next node
// You cannot randomly access a value in the linked list, you have to traverse the list as there is no index
